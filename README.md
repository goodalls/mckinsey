# Coding Challenge:
- Create a calendar that takes as input an array of objects.
- Each object contains a start time and an end time for the event.
- Events in the same day stack up.
- Build out the monthly view for 2 months only.
- Include ability to add event by double clicking on a particular day.
- Have it work on iPad all the way up.
- Try to replicate as much as possible the layout in image 1.
- Clicking on a event should pop up a small window like on image 2.
- If you're using a mac it's the same cal dat you get but just for the month view.

## Synopsis
- having never created a calendar before I definitly found this challenge, um challenging.

- I last minute tred to emplimnet the doubleclick feature so I started out hardcoding it and did not have time to make it dynamic. 

- I have a bug on the pop up part where it is instead duplicating the first event on the calendar with more time I am sure that I could get that working. 

- Thought it would be a good idea to let you know the good and the bads. I would appriciate any feed back, I am trying to absorb as much as possible.

- thank you for this oppertunity
